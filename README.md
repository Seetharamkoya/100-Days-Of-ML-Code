## SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION
Predicting a response using a single feature.
It is a method to predict dependent variable (Y) based on values of independent variable (X). It is assumed that that the two variable aren linearly related. Hence, we try to find a linear function that predicts the response value(y) as  accuractely as possible as a function of the feature or independent variable(x).
