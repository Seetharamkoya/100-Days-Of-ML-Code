## SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION
Predicting a response using a single feature.
It is a method to predict dependent variable (Y) based on values of independent variable (X). It is assumed that that the two variable aren linearly related. Hence, we try to find a linear function that predicts the response value(y) as  accuractely as possible as a function of the feature or independent variable(x).

y = b + b1x1

y = Dependent variable
x1 = Independent variable
b = Intercept
b1 = slope


In this refressionmodel, we are trying to minimize the erros in the prediction by finding the "line of best fit"  - the regression line from the errors would be minimal. we are trying to minimize the length between the observed value (yi) and the predicted value from our model (yp).

min {sum(yi - yp)^2}
